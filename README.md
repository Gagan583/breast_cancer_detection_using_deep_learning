**Project Overview**

This project aims to detect breast cancer at early stages using Deep Learning models.
It uses image datasets (mammography/ultrasound) and applies CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

The goal is to assist medical professionals by providing fast and accurate predictions.


**Key Features**

✔️ Deep Learning–based image classification
✔️ Uses CNN / Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet, etc.)
✔️ High accuracy and fast inference
✔️ Image preprocessing (resizing, noise removal)
✔️ Works on Mammogram/Ultrasound images
✔️ End-to-end implementation in Python

**Model Performance**

Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 98%
Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve included in notebooks.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how deep learning can significantly improve early-stage breast cancer detection using medical imaging.
It can be further extended into a real-time clinical decision support system.
